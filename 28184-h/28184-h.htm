<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Wake! For the Hack can scatter into flight</div>
<div>Shakespere and Dante in a single Night!</div>
<div class="i1">The Penny-a-liner is Abroad, and strikes</div>
<div>Our Modern Literature with blithering Blight.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>II</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Before Historical Romances died,</div>
<div>Methought a Voice from Art's Olympus cried,</div>
<div class="i1">"When all Dumas and Scott is still for Sale,</div>
<div>Why nod o'er drowsy Tales, by Tyros tried?"</div>
</div></div>

<h3>III</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>A cock-sure Crew with Names ne'er heard before</div>
<div>Greedily shouted&mdash;"Open then the Door!</div>
<div class="i1">You know how little Stuff is going to live,</div>
<div>But where it came from there is plenty More."</div>
</div></div>

<h3>IV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Now the New Year reviving old Desires,</div>
<div>The Artist poor to Calendars aspires,</div>
<div class="i1">But of the Stuff the Publisher puts out</div>
<div>Most in the Paper Basket soon suspires.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>V</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Harum indeed is gone, and Lady Rose,</div>
<div>And Janice Meredith, where no one knows;</div>
<div class="i1">But still the Author gushes overtime,</div>
<div>And many a Poet babbles on in Prose.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>VI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Aldrich's lips are lock'd; but people buy</div>
<div>High-piping Authoresses, boomed sky-high.</div>
<div class="i1">"How Fine!"&mdash;the Publisher cries to the Mob,</div>
<div>That monumental Cheek to justify.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Come, fill the Purse, to Publishers, this Spring,</div>
<div>Your Manuscripts of paltry Passion bring:</div>
<div class="i1">The New York Times has oft a little Way</div>
<div>Of praising&mdash;let The Times your praises sing.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Whether by Century or Doubleday,</div>
<div>Whether Macmillan or the Harpers pay,</div>
<div class="i1">The Publisher prints new books every Year;</div>
<div>The Critics will keep Busy, anyway!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>IX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Each Morn a thousand Volumes brings, you say;</div>
<div>Yes, but who reads the Books of Yesterday?</div>
<div class="i1">And this first Autumn List that brings the New</div>
<div>Shall take The Pit and Mrs. Wiggs away.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>X</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Well, let it take them! What, are we not through</div>
<div>With Richard Calmady and Emmy Lou?</div>
<div class="i1">Let Ade and Dooley guy us as they will,</div>
<div>Or Ella Wheeler Wilcox&mdash;heed not you.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>With me despise this kind of Fiction rude</div>
<div>That just divides the Rotten from the Good,</div>
<div class="i1">Where names of Poe and Dickens are forgot&mdash;</div>
<div>And Peace to Thackeray with his giant Brood!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>A Book of Limericks&mdash;Nonsense, anyhow&mdash;</div>
<div>Alice in Wonderland, the Purple Cow</div>

<div>Ah, this were Modern Literature enow!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Some for the stories of The World; and some</div>
<div>Sigh for the Boston Transcript till it come;</div>
<div class="i1">Ah, take The Sun, and let The Herald go,</div>
<div>Nor heed the Yellow Journalistic scum!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Look to the blowing Advertiser&mdash;"Lo,</div>
<div>Booming's the way," he says, "to make Books go!</div>
<div class="i1">I advertise until I've drained my Purse,</div>
<div>And huge Editions on the Market throw."</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And those who made a Mint off Miss MacLane,</div>
<div>And those who shuddered at her Jests profane,</div>
<div class="i1">Alike consigned her to Oblivion,</div>
<div>And buried once, would not dig up again.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Anthony Hope men set their hearts upon&mdash;</div>
<div>Like Conan Doyle he prospered; and anon,</div>
<div class="i1">Remained unopened on the dusty Shelf,</div>
<div>Delighting us an Hour&mdash;and then was gone.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Think, in this gaudy monthly Magazine</div>
<div>Whose Covers are Soapette and Breakfastine,</div>
<div class="i1">How Author after Author with his Tale</div>
<div>Fills his fool Pages, and no more is seen.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>They say that now Miss Myra Kelly reaps</div>
<div>Rewards that Howells used to have for Keeps:</div>
<div class="i1">And Seton, that great Hunter of Wild Beasts</div>
<div>Has Coin ahead; Cash comes to him in Heaps!</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>I sometimes think that never Prose is read</div>
<div>So good as that by Advertising bred,</div>
<div class="i1">And every Verse Sapolian poets sing</div>
<div>Brings laurel wreaths once twin'd for Spenser's head.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And this audacious Author, young and green</div>
<div>In Smart Set&mdash;surely you know whom I mean&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Ah, look upon him lightly! for who knows</div>
<div>But once in Lippincott's he wrote unseen!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Ah, my Belov&egrave;d, write the Book that clears</div>
<div><span class="smcap">To-day</span> of dreary Debt and sad Arrears;</div>
<div class="i1"><i>To-morrow!</i>&mdash;Why, To-morrow I may see</div>
<div>My Nonsense popular as Edward Lear's.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>For some we've read, the month's Six Selling Best</div>
<div>The Bookman scored with elephantine Jest,</div>
<div class="i1">Have sold a half a Million in a Year,</div>
<div>Yet no one ever heard of them, out West!</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And we, that now within the Editor's Room</div>
<div>Make merry while we have our little Boom,</div>
<div class="i1">Ourselves must we give way to next month's Set&mdash;</div>
<div>Girls with Three Names, who know not Who from Whom!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Ah, make the most of what we yet may do,</div>
<div>Before our Royalties have vanish'd, too,</div>
<div class="i1">Book after Book, and under Book to lie,</div>
<div>Sans Page, sans Cover, Reader&mdash;or Review!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Alike for those who for <span class="smcap">To-day</span> have Shame,</div>
<div>And those who strive for some <span class="smcap">To-morrow's</span> Fame,</div>
<div class="i1">A Critic from anonymous Darkness cries,</div>
<div>"Fools, your Reward will fool you, just the Same!"</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXVI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Why, e'en Marie Corelli, who discuss'd</div>
<div>Of the Two Worlds so learnedly, is thrust</div>
<div class="i1">Like Elbert Hubbard forth; her Words to Scorn</div>
<div>Are scatter'd, and her Books by Critics cussed.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXVII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Myself when young did eagerly peruse</div>
<div>James, Meredith and Hardy&mdash;but to lose</div>
<div class="i1">My Reason, trying to make Head or Tail;</div>
<div>The more I read, the more did they confuse.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>With them the Germs of Madness did I sow,</div>
<div>And with "Two Magics" sought to make it grow;</div>
<div class="i1">Yet this was all the Answer that I found&mdash;</div>
<div>"What it is all about, I do not know!"</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXIX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Into the Library, and <i>Why</i> not knowing,</div>
<div>Nor <i>What I Want</i>, I find myself a-going;</div>
<div class="i1">And out of it, with Nothing fit to Read&mdash;</div>
<div>Such is the Catalogue's an&aelig;mic Showing.</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>What, without asking, to be hypnotized</div>
<div>Into a Sale of Stevenson disguised?</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, many a page of Bernard Shaw's last Play</div>
<div>Must drown the thought of Novels Dramatized!</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Up from the Country, into gay Broadway</div>
<div>I came, and bought a Scribner's, yesterday,</div>
<div class="i1">And many a Tale I read and understood,</div>
<div>But not the master-tale of Kipling's "They."</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXXII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>There was a Plot to which I found no Key;</div>
<div>And Others seem to be as Dull as Me;</div>
<div class="i1">Some little talk there was of Ghosts, and Such,</div>
<div>Then Mrs. Bathurst left me more at Sea!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXXIII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Kim could not answer&mdash;Sherlock Holmes would fail&mdash;</div>
<div>The most enlightened Browningite turn pale</div>
<div class="i1">In futile Wonder and in blank Dismay;</div>
<div>Say, is there ANY Meaning to that Tale?</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXXIV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Then of the Critic, he who works behind</div>
<div>The Author's back, I tried the Clue to find;</div>
<div class="i1">But he, too, was in Darkness; and I heard</div>
<div>A Literary Agent say&mdash;"<span class="smcap">They All are Blind</span>!"</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Then, from the lips of Editor, I learn,</div>
<div>"This Story is the Kind for which I Yearn;</div>
<div class="i1">Its Advertising brought us such Renown,</div>
<div>We jumped Three Hundred Thousand, on that Turn!"</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXXVI</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>I think the man exaggerated some</div>
<div>His increased Circulation,&mdash;but, I vum!</div>
<div class="i1">If I could get Two Thousand for one Tale,</div>
<div>I'd write him Something that would simply Hum!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XXXVII</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>For I remember, shopping by the way,</div>
<div>I saw a Novel writ by Bertha Clay;</div>

<h3>XXXIX</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>And not a Book that from our Shelves we throw</div>
<div>To the Salvation Army, but shall go</div>
<div class="i1">To vitiate the Taste of some poor Soul</div>
<div>Who can get nothing else to read&mdash;go Slow!</div>

<h3>XL</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>As then the Poet for his morning Sup</div>
<div>Fills with a Metaphor his mental Cup,</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>So, when <span class="smcap">Who's-Who</span> records your silly Name,</div>
<div>You'll think that you have found the Road to Fame;</div>
<div class="i1">And though ten thousand other Names are there,</div>
<div>You'll fancy you're a Genius, just the Same!</div>
</div></div>

<h3>XLIV</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Why, if an Author can fling Art aside,</div>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
